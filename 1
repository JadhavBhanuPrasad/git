GIT is version control system, most widely used one is git
to keep track of changes you made in local version system, we try keeping new names,
it doesnt identify languages, it just look for changes

GIT is Distributed V C System

GIT is a language to make changes in GITHUB
GITHUB is a server

CENTRALISED V C : main folder on a location , 
                  where all the files are there, 
                  which you want you download and make changes and push back, 
                  everyone has one working copy


DISTRIBUTED V C :   contains multiple repositires, 
                    here whole folder is pulled out, 
                    all repositries as one copy, 
                    each user has own repository and working copy


keeps track of changes by timestamp -> local version system

CVC -> keeps the track of time changes, checkins Over Time

DVC -> takes snapshot of original version..only when we commit changes, then it takes the snapshot and compares with original...if no changes then , no snapshot...keeps track of all snapshots, so when you want previous one you can take it by going back 


Git three states :
1. modified -> changed the file but not commited(commit at local repository)
2. stages -> mared a modified file
3. Committed -> data is safely stored in your local database



git init -> initialising the repository ot be git repository
git status -> to chek status
git add . -> stage all modifications
git add 'file_name' -> stage particular file

//commit -> to make permanent on local repository

git commit -m "first commit" .... -m : message " " : whatever message you type
git config user.name "user_name"  
git config user.email "user_email"
git push -u origin master ... to authenticate ... -u : upstream from local to github
git pull ... remote repository to local repostiory
master -> name of main branch

Branch
git branch 'branchname'
git checkout branch1 -> move from master to branch1
